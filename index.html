        <p>My name is Justin Son and I'm an apsiring software engineer. I'm currently enrolled in a bootcamp called 'Learning Fuze' slated to start on January 24th, 2022. The reason I'm joining a bootcamp is because I want to explore the world of technology. I've always been interested in tech as a child, but never had the chance to actually learn the skills needed in my school years. My hope with software engineering is that I'll be able to work at a company or create one myself where I'll have a chance to work on things that make a difference in the world.</p>
        <p>Before I decided to pursue software engineering, I attended a liberal arts Christian college called Calvin College. Here, I majored in business finance with the hope of working on Wall Street. For some reason however, I ended up working in the advertising industry for my first job at an ad agency. I worked here for about 2 years until I moved to another ad agency (I wasn't here for too long). After this agency, I decided to work for an ad tech company where I got to interact with a little bit of software. This eventually led me to be interested in software and change careers. I'm super excited and I can't wait until the day I can call myself a software engineer (hopefully).</p>
